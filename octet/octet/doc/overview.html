    <h1>Overiew of Octet</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Octet is not a game engine. Octet is a framework for teaching low level programming
    in games and is far less complex than a game engine. We aim to teach the fundamentals of
    game technology construction, not how to call APIs. If you want a pre-built engine,
    use Unity - it is well supported and idiot-proof.</p>
    <p>Octet supports only one graphics API - OpenGL and then only the mobile subset "GLES".
    This enables the user to get down and dirty with the closest layer to the hardware available
    on the platform. GLES runs on PC, MAC, iOS, Android, Raspberry Pi, Panda boards, toasters,
    nuclear missiles and toy rabbits. By contrast, DirectX runs on PCs only.</p>
    <p>Octet supports only one Audio API - OpenAL. There is also a fake OpenAL for running on
    PCs where the real OpenAL is not installed, this makes Octet have fewer dependencies.</p>
    <p>For GPGPU support, you can use OpenCL or compute shaders. If you want your application
    to only run on PCs, use CUDA. We will provide support for SPIR and SYCL in due course
    also as these standards emerge.</p>
    <h2>Containers</h2>
    <p>Octet containers behave much like STL containers. Game programmers usually avoid STL
    because of the poor implementation, but this is becomming less of a problem with time and
    we may switch to using STL in the future.
    <p>The dynarray class behaves like std::vector, but has additional support for serialization.
    The most common error is to use dynarray (or std::vector) with complex classes. Many classes
    do not have copy constructors, which are required to do this and will probbaly crash at runime.
    Instead use <b>dynarray&lt;myclass*&gt; or dynarray&lt;ref&lt;myclass&gt; &gt;</b> with myclass
    derived from <b>resource</b>.</p>
    <p>The dictonary class maps ASCII strings to any object, this is about two orders of magnitude faster
    than std::map&lt;std::string, ...&gt;</p>
    <p>The ref class is like the boost intrusive_ptr class and manages reference counted objects.
    If the object is derived from <b>resource</b> then this happens automagicly. Try to avoid
    using naked new and delete operators. That is very dangerous...</p>
    <h2>Exceptions and iostreams</h2>
    <p>Game programmers do not use exceptions - these
    are the frequent cause of bugs and bloat the code as much as two times reducing performance
    correspondingly. The principle of "handle your errors at source" is utterly important. Do not throw
    exceptions, the Ariane 5 spacecraft is a good example of why you should do this!</p>
    <p>Use "defensive programming" if possible. Use assertions which will blow up in debug mode,
    but check pointers and return harmlessly if things are not as expected</p>
    We also avoid "cout &lt;&lt; x;" (iostreams) as this leads to very large,
    low performance code.<p>
    <h2>Logging</h2>
    <p>Octet has a "log" function in app_utils.h that can be used to trace errors and progress.
    Use this to debug data structures and userstand internal processes.</p>
    The log function returns a file pointer to the output stream that can be used with fprintf
    or dumps.<p>
    <h2>Scene structure</h2>
    <p>Octet has a heirachical node structure, like Unity, but uses nodes to render "mesh instances"
    which associate mesh data (attributes) with materials (uniforms).
    This is designed for high performance rendering where typically the scene will be sorted
    in various ways to minimise state changes and overdraw. At present, there is no
    LOD, occluders, conditional rendering, multithread scene optimization or other things
    common in game engines, but it is easy to implement these things. To Add them as part
    of Octet would make it harder to understand. If you want to see this in action, look
    at OGRE. It is unlikely that students will create scenes that are complex enough
    to requite these things, and I am happy to provide examples when necessary.</p>
    <p>See example_box and example_duck to see how to construct scenes.</p>
    <h2>Procedural geometry</h2>
    <p>Octet makes it easy to generate procedural geometry which makes for interesting worlds
    such as Micecraft clones, lego seascapes and procedural cities. Take a look at example_geometry
    to show how to make your own shapes. For example, you could build trees by creating cylinder
    trunks and branches with quads for leaves.</p>
    <h2>Physics</h2>
    <p>Octet can use the Bullet physics system for physics based animation. See example_physics
    to see this in action. Bullet allows you to create rigid bodies and constraints to make
    worlds with physics.</p>
    <h2>Open projects</h2>
    <p>Currently the vehicle and cubemap projects need completion. I would be very happy
    to recieve patches for these for review.</p>
    <p>We are very much in need of a continuous integration system for Octet. We need to be able
    to build the examples on Mac, Linux and PC on every checkin. If build errors occur, or tests
    (to be done!) fail, we need to send a mail. We could use buildbot, for example.</p>
    <h2>Ports</h2>
    <p>Help with ports would be appreciated. We would like to target Android, Google NaCl,
    iOS, emscripten and others with the absolute minimum of glue. Please consult before trying this as
    we need to see how little we can get away with.</p>
    <h2>Submitting patches</h2>
    <p>If something doesn't work, please don't complain, but fix the problem and submit a patch.</p>
    <p>If you use git to check out the project and edit files until they work, you can use
    <b>git diff</b> to generate a patch. I will review the patches and commit the smallest,
    tidiest ones. Monster patches may be eliminated. If you submit a couple of good patches,
    I'll give you commit access on the project, but reserve the right to roll back.</p>
