    <h1>Getting started with Octet</h1>
    <h2>Windows</h2>
    <p>On Windows, we can build with most flavours of visual studio, but I reccomend
    visual studio 2013 express as it is small and free</p>
    <p>The src/examples directories contain .sln files which you can click on.</p>
    <p>If this does not work with your version of visual studio, click on the .vcprojx
    file and it will create a solution.</p>
    <p>You can then build with ctrl-shift-B and run with F5.</p>
    <h2>Mac OSX</h2>
    <p>There are some xcode projects, although they are not as well supported</p>
    <p>On all platforms there is Makefile support. We reccomend unxutils from sourceforge
    and useing the "vcvars" batch files from the visual studio install on windows</p>
